# Financial Modeling Suite

A comprehensive financial modeling toolkit for investment analysis, valuation, and risk assessment using industry-standard methodologies.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
- Build complete DCF models with multiple growth scenarios
- Calculate terminal values using perpetuity growth and exit multiple methods
- Determine weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
- Generate enterprise and equity valuations

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis
- Test key assumptions impact on valuation
- Create data tables for multiple variables
- Generate tornado charts for sensitivity ranking
- Identify critical value drivers

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Run thousands of scenarios with probability distributions
- Model uncertainty in key inputs
- Generate confidence intervals for valuations
- Calculate probability of achieving targets

### 4. Scenario Planning
- Build best/base/worst case scenarios
- Model different economic environments
- Test strategic alternatives
- Compare outcome probabilities

## Input Requirements

### For DCF Analysis
- Historical financial statements (3-5 years)
- Revenue growth assumptions
- Operating margin projections
- Capital expenditure forecasts
- Working capital requirements
- Terminal growth rate or exit multiple
- Discount rate components (risk-free rate, beta, market premium)

### For Sensitivity Analysis
- Base case model
- Variable ranges to test
- Key metrics to track

### For Monte Carlo Simulation
- Probability distributions for uncertain variables
- Correlation assumptions between variables
- Number of iterations (typically 1,000-10,000)

### For Scenario Planning
- Scenario definitions and assumptions
- Probability weights for scenarios
- Key performance indicators to track

## Output Formats

## Best Practices Applied

### Modeling Standards
- Consistent formatting and structure
- Clear assumption documentation
- Separation of inputs, calculations, outputs
- Error checking and validation
- Version control and change tracking

### Valuation Principles
- Use multiple valuation methods for triangulation
- Apply appropriate risk adjustments
- Consider market comparables
- Validate against trading multiples
- Document key assumptions clearly

### Risk Management
- Identify and quantify key risks
- Use probability-weighted scenarios
- Stress test extreme cases
- Consider correlation effects
- Provide confidence intervals

## Example Usage

"Build a DCF model for this technology company using the attached financials"

"Run a Monte Carlo simulation on this acquisition model with 5,000 iterations"

"Create sensitivity analysis showing impact of growth rate and WACC on valuation"

"Develop three scenarios for this expansion project with probability weights"

## Scripts Included

- `dcf_model.py`: Complete DCF valuation engine
- `sensitivity_analysis.py`: Sensitivity testing framework

## Limitations and Disclaimers

- Models are only as good as their assumptions
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Market conditions can change rapidly
- Regulatory and tax changes may impact results
- Professional judgment required for interpretation
- Not a substitute for professional financial advice

## Quality Checks

The model automatically performs:
1. Balance sheet balancing checks
2. Cash flow reconciliation
3. Circular reference resolution
4. Sensitivity bound checking
5. Statistical validation of Monte Carlo results

## Updates and Maintenance

- Models use latest financial theory and practices
- Regular updates for market parameter defaults
- Incorporation of regulatory changes
- Continuous improvement based on usage patterns
